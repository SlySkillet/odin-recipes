        <h1>Description:</h1>
        <p>This is a recipe I used to cook for a restaurant in Big Sky, MT. I have fond memories of this town (not of the restaurant), though I have ended up eating this at home with some regularity. Sweet potatoes are delicious, nutritious, and a great vehicle for old bay!
