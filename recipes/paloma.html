        <h1>Description:</h1>
        <p>This is a favorite cocktail for the rotation. I highly suggest using mezcal if you can get your hands on it. This is a drink I started making in Oaxaca where the mezcal is cheap and plentiful. If that is not the case for you (I'm sorry) tequila will work just fine.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large grapefruits</li>
            <li>grapefruit soda, preferably squirt</li>
            <li>1 lime, quartered</li>
            <li>3 oz mezcal</li>
            <li>sal de gusano</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut all grapefruits in half and squeeze out juice. If it's too pulply for your liking, take the time to strain it. Alternatively this can be done with bottled grapefruit juice, though fresh squeezed is preferred.</li>
            <li>Wet the rim of your high ball glass with lime and coat the rim with sal de gusano.</li>
            <li>Add to highball glass with cubed ice and mexcal.</li>
            <li>Top off with a splash of grapefruit soda and stir well.</li>
            <li>Finish with a lime quarter.</li>
        </ol>
